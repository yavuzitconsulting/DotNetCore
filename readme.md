#IMPORTANT NOTE
Fork by YITC (Yavuz IT Consulting).

This project is maintained by rafaelfgx.

The main reason to provide this project and the packages that come with it are to ensure a consistent version and change history, since the original maintainer/creator seems to overwrite the commit history from time to time (this is not to say that he does not have good reasons to, but i would like to keep track of any changes manually and provide the changes here).

Furthermore, i would like to be able to maintain and update these packages and repositories manually asap, independent of the original project changes.

To conclude, this project is not meant to spoof or cloak the original work in any way, please feel free to contact me if you have any concerns.

Thank you for your understanding, and a big thanks to the original maintainer rafaelfgx for the effort and quality he put into this project.

This readme file will be kept unchanged in the future, links will lead to the original maintainers repository.
